# Lumen

<p>Lumen is an advanced dynamic global illumination (GI) system introduced in Unreal Engine 5. It is designed to provide real-time, highly realistic lighting and global illumination effects in your virtual scenes.</p>
<p>Traditionally, achieving realistic global illumination in real-time graphics has been challenging, often requiring precomputed lightmaps or other approximations. Lumen, however, brings dynamic global illumination to the forefront, allowing for interactive and dynamic lighting changes without sacrificing visual fidelity.</p>
<p>With Lumen, the lighting calculations are performed in real time, taking into account the geometry and materials in the scene. This means that the lighting and global illumination effects respond dynamically to changes in the environment, such as moving objects, changing light sources, or alterations in time of day.</p>
<p>One of the key advantages of Lumen is its ability to accurately simulate indirect lighting, which includes light that bounces off surfaces and contributes to the overall illumination of a scene. Lumen achieves this by tracing rays in real time, capturing the indirect lighting information and applying it to the affected surfaces. This results in realistic color bleeding, soft shadows, and subtle reflections that contribute to the overall visual fidelity of the scene.</p>
<p>Additionally, Lumen incorporates high-quality ray-traced soft shadows, allowing for accurate and realistic shadowing effects. These shadows dynamically adapt to changes in the scene, providing precise and believable shadowing for moving objects or shifting light sources.</p>
<p>Lumen also takes advantage of the virtualized micropolygon technology called Nanite, introduced in Unreal Engine 5. Nanite allows for importing and rendering extremely detailed assets with millions or even billions of polygons. Lumen leverages this detailed geometry to accurately calculate lighting interactions and achieve highly realistic results.</p>
<p>Overall, Lumen in Unreal Engine 5 offers a groundbreaking dynamic global illumination solution, enabling real-time lighting and global illumination effects with remarkable accuracy and visual fidelity. It allows for interactive and dynamic lighting changes, bringing your virtual environments to life with stunning realism and immersion.</p>
