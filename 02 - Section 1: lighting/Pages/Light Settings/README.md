# Light Settings

<p>In Unreal Engine 5, there are several important settings for lights that can greatly impact the appearance and behavior of the light sources in your scenes. Here is a list of the top settings for lights in row 5, along with their properties:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. Intensity:</strong> The intensity setting controls the brightness of the light source. It determines how much light the source emits and affects the overall illumination of the scene.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Color:</strong> The color setting allows you to specify the color of the light. You can choose from a wide range of colors to create the desired lighting atmosphere or mimic specific lighting conditions, such as warm sunlight or cool moonlight.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Temperature:</strong> The temperature setting is used to adjust the color temperature of the light. It is measured in Kelvin and affects the perceived warmth or coolness of the light. Higher values produce cooler tones, while lower values create warmer tones.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4. Shadows: </strong>The shadows setting determines whether the light source casts shadows in the scene. You can choose to enable or disable shadows, and depending on the light type, you may have additional options to control the shadow quality, softness, or distance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5. Attenuation:</strong> Attenuation controls how the intensity of the light diminishes with distance. It determines how quickly or slowly the light fades as it moves away from the light source. You can adjust the attenuation settings to achieve the desired falloff behavior.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>6. Cone Angle (for spotlights):</strong> This setting is specific to spotlights and determines the angle of the cone-shaped light beam. You can modify the cone angle to control the spread or focus of the light, allowing for wide or narrow coverage.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>7. Source Radius (for area lights):</strong> Area lights have a source radius property that determines the size of the light-emitting surface. Adjusting this setting can affect the softness or hardness of shadows and create different lighting effects.</p>
<p>These are some of the top settings for lights in Unreal Engine 5, and tweaking these parameters can have a significant impact on the appearance and behavior of the light sources in your scenes. By carefully adjusting these settings, you can achieve the desired lighting effects and create immersive and visually stunning environments.</p>
