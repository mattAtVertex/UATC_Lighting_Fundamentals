# IES Profiles

<p>In Unreal Engine 5, IES profiles are used to simulate the precise distribution of light emitted by real-world light fixtures. IES, which stands for Illuminating Engineering Society, is a standardized format for storing photometric data about how light is distributed in a specific light source.</p>
<p>IES profiles are commonly used to achieve accurate and realistic lighting effects in architectural visualization, interior design, and other applications where precise light representation is crucial. By using IES profiles, you can accurately reproduce the lighting characteristics of various light fixtures, such as lamps, bulbs, or luminaires.</p>
<p>To use IES profiles in Unreal Engine 5, you can assign an IES texture to a light source, such as a point light or spot light. The IES profile data stored in the texture determines how the light is emitted in different directions, creating realistic lighting patterns and intensities.</p>
<p>When applying an IES profile, you can control various properties of the light source, such as intensity, color, and attenuation, to further customize the appearance of the light. This allows you to fine-tune the lighting to match the specific characteristics of the chosen IES profile and create the desired mood or atmosphere.</p>
<p>Using IES profiles in Unreal Engine 5 enhances the realism of your scenes by accurately replicating the behavior of real-world light fixtures. This can be especially useful when creating architectural visualizations or simulating interior lighting scenarios, where precise lighting representation is essential for achieving a convincing result.</p>
<p>By leveraging IES profiles, Unreal Engine 5 empowers you to create immersive and visually accurate lighting environments, allowing you to achieve a high level of realism and fidelity in your projects.</p>
