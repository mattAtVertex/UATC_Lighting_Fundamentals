# Types of Lights

<p>In Unreal Engine 5, there are several types of lights that you can use to illuminate your virtual scenes. Each light type has its own unique properties and characteristics. Here is a list of the different types of lights and their key properties:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. Directional Light:</strong> A Directional Light simulates sunlight or a distant light source that emits parallel rays. It has a specified direction but no position. Key properties include intensity, color, and shadows. Directional lights affect the entire scene uniformly, casting shadows that mimic the sun's direction.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Point Light: </strong>A Point Light emits light uniformly in all directions from a specific point in 3D space. It is often used to simulate light bulbs or small light sources. Key properties include position, intensity, color, and attenuation, which determines how the light diminishes with distance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Spot Light: </strong>A Spot Light emits light in a cone-shaped beam from a specific position and direction. It is useful for simulating focused lights, such as flashlights or stage spotlights. Key properties include position, direction, intensity, color, cone angle, and attenuation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4. Rect Light: </strong>A Rect Light emits light from a rectangular surface in a specified direction. It is commonly used to simulate area lights or light panels. Key properties include position, direction, intensity, color, size, and falloff.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5. Sky Light:</strong> A Sky Light simulates the lighting from the sky or environment. It provides ambient lighting and captures the color and intensity of the sky. Key properties include intensity, color, and capturing options to control the quality and resolution of the sky environment.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>6. Atmospheric Fog: </strong>While not a direct light source, Atmospheric Fog affects the overall lighting and atmosphere of the scene. It simulates effects like haze, fog, or mist, adding depth and realism to outdoor environments. Key properties include density, color, height falloff, and scattering options.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>7. Volumetric Light: </strong>Volumetric Light creates volumetric lighting effects, such as light rays or god rays, that can interact with atmospheric particles. It adds a sense of depth and atmosphere to your scenes. Key properties include intensity, color, density, and scattering options.</p>
<p>These different types of lights can be combined and customized to achieve a wide range of lighting setups, from natural daylight to dramatic and stylized lighting scenarios. Understanding the properties and behaviors of each light type will help you effectively create the desired lighting atmosphere in your Unreal Engine 5 projects.</p>
